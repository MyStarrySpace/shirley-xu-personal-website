excerpt: My personal website is built using Next.js with Typescript, deployed using Vercel, and features my own custom graphics. While the website is client-side only, I used SWR to make API calls to pull the list of projects. Each project I make will be featured in its own custom markdown file. The elements on each page are modular and animated with Framer Motion.

## My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website, a digital space where I've blended creativity, technical expertise, and a keen sense of user experience. Since I'm a web developer and designer, I wanted to create a platform that would showcase my skills and reflect my philosophy as a creator. I've leveraged cutting-edge technologies and innovative design to craft a website that is both visually appealing and highly functional. Here are some of the key features of my personal website:

* **Responsive Design:** I've carefully crafted the site using Bootstrap and custom SCSS, ensuring a fluid and optimal viewing experience across various devices. Whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the content reshapes itself, maintaining visual appeal and accessibility.

* **Dynamic Interactions:** Leveraging the power of Framer Motion and the Intersection Observer, I've added subtle animations and transitions throughout the site. These elements don't just add visual flair; they breathe life into the content, creating a more engaging and immersive experience without overwhelming the user.

* **Modular Components:** I've built the site's architecture with reusability in mind. Components like the navigation bar, responsive cards, and project lists can be adapted and reused, enhancing maintainability and scalability. This modular approach reflects my commitment to clean and efficient coding practices.

* **Content Structure:** The site is thoughtfully segmented into dedicated sections, including About Me, Contact, and Projects. I've utilized icons, images, and carefully chosen typography to create a visually coherent and compelling narrative. From sharing my background to showcasing my work, every detail is meticulously crafted to provide insight into who I am and what I do.

* **Interactive Contact Form:** In the Contact section, I've designed an interactive form, integrating it with Formspree for streamlined communication. This modern, user-friendly approach encourages visitors to connect with me, reflecting my openness to collaboration and new opportunities.

* **SEO Optimization:** Recognizing the importance of search engine visibility, I've employed Next.js's built-in SEO features to ensure the site reaches its intended audience. Every page is optimized for search engines, maximizing its reach and impact.

* **Dynamic Content Loading:** To provide a seamless browsing experience, I've implemented the SWR library for dynamic content loading. Whether it's my latest projects or updated information, the site is built to adapt and refresh content without manual intervention.

* **Personalized Portfolio:** The Projects section is more than a list; it's a curated showcase of my work. Utilizing responsive cards and dynamic loading, I present my portfolio in a way that is both visually appealing and informative. Each project is accompanied by details and visuals, reflecting the breadth and depth of my expertise.

In summary, my personal website is more than a digital resume; it's a reflection of my philosophy as a developer and designer. I believe in the harmony of form and function, the marriage of aesthetics and usability. Through modern technologies, innovative design, and attention to the smallest details, I've created a platform that not only showcases my skills but also stands as a testament to my dedication to quality, innovation, and user satisfaction.

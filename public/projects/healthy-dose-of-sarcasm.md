# Creation of Assets for "Healthy Dose of Sarcasm"

I had the unique opportunity to collaborate with the Twitch streamer "Healthy Dose of Sarcasm" to design and animate assets for their gaming channel. The commission was a thrilling challenge that required a deep understanding of their distinct personality and brand, characterized by a graphic, dynamic, and edgy style.

* **Inspiration & Concept:** Drawing inspiration from the raw energy of graffiti art, I set out to craft visuals that would resonate with their bold and unconventional persona. The concept revolved around creating animated banners and Twitch emotes that would not only match but amplify their brand identity.

* **Design Process:** Utilizing Affinity Designer, a powerful graphic design tool, I shaped the assets with precision and creativity. Bold colors were strategically chosen to ensure that the designs would stand out, capturing attention and reflecting the streamer's vibrant energy.

* **Animating with Flair:** Transitioning into Adobe After Effects, I breathed life into the static designs by crafting dynamic animations. One of the standout features was the illusion of liquid pouring out and filling up. This effect added a fluid and lively dimension to the visuals, harmonizing with the overall edgy theme.

* **Wave Animation:** Another intriguing aspect was the creation of a wave-like motion for the letters, making them rise and fall in a rhythmic pattern. This innovative touch further reinforced the dynamic nature of the brand, adding a playful yet sophisticated twist.

* **Collaboration & Feedback:** Throughout the process, I maintained close communication with "Healthy Dose of Sarcasm," ensuring that the designs were aligned with their vision and expectations. Their feedback and insights were invaluable in fine-tuning the assets, achieving a perfect balance between creativity and brand consistency.

* **Final Deliverables:** The final package consisted of meticulously crafted animated screens and emotes, each piece echoing the streamer's unique style and passion. The combination of graffiti-inspired design, bold coloring, and inventive animations resulted in assets that are not only visually stunning but also deeply connected to the essence of "Healthy Dose of Sarcasm."

# The Character Design Process

I embarked on a captivating project to illustrate a character for [name redacted], an endeavor that allowed me to explore both visual creativity and psychological insight. The client's unique personality traits—initial shyness that melts into kindness and warmth—guided my hand as I set out to design a character that would resonate with these characteristics.

## The Initial Sketch

Utilizing Clip Studio Paint, I began the process by sending various sketches to the client. Through collaboration and active engagement, we explored different attributes, such as bags, caps, coats, and footwear. These sketches were instrumental in defining the core elements of the character, allowing the client to choose their preferred design features.

## Final Creation and Refinement
Inspired by the client's desire for the character to "have a bit more oomph," I took the chosen sketch and worked on exaggerating specific aspects of the silhouette. I emphasized the toes and heels of the boots, the collar/hood of the jacket, the jaggedness and graphic quality of the hair, and the brim of the cap, injecting energy and distinctiveness into the character's appearance.

Incorporating the client's favorite color, blue, I crafted a bold, graphic color scheme. The inclusion of their graffiti-style catbot logo added a personalized touch, linking the character to their brand identity.

Through this two-phase process of initial sketching and final refinement, I was able to translate the client's vision into a memorable art piece. The project stands as a testament to my abilities as a versatile and responsive artist, capable of working closely with clients to create artwork that resonates with their personality and brand.

The expression sheet at the top was created to showcase the character's range of emotions. The expressions were designed to be versatile and dynamic, with a focus on the character's shy nature. The expressions are as follows:

* **Top Right:** A versatile upset/shocked/annoyed expression. The dynamic flow of the hair creates motion, suggesting a reactive turn of the head. Even in this state of shock, a hint of the character's initial shyness is reflected in the nuanced details.
* **Top Middle:** An exasperated, "I'm done with this" expression. A single drop of sweat adds a touch of difficulty, further emphasizing the character's shy nature as they grapple with a challenging situation.
* **Top Left:** A heavily sweating, nervous expression. Shake lines and a slumping coat depict the character's uneasiness and drooped shoulders, encapsulating their shyness and apprehension.
* **Middle Left:** A happy, welcoming expression, with the head slightly tilted upwards, contrasting the character's natural downward tilt. The uplifting expression still maintains a gentle reserve, aligning with the character's initial shyness.
* **Middle:** A neutral expression looking to the side, suitable for normal analysis or pensive moods. This unassuming expression subtly hints at the character's introspective and shy nature.
* **Middle Right:** Another shocked/surprised reaction, but this time to the side, used for reacting or analyzing. It pairs well with the middle expression and maintains the underlying shy demeanor, even in a state of surprise.

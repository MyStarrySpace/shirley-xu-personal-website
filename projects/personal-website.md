title: My Personal Website
date: Dec 29, 2021
excerpt: My personal website is built using Next.js with Typescript, deployed using Vercel, and features my own custom graphics. While the website is client-side only, I used SWR to make API calls to pull the list of projects. Each project I make will be featured in its own custom markdown file. The elements on each page are modular and animated with Framer Motion.
